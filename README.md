# DSSG2017-Equity

## Description

In the past years, Seattle has seen unprecedented population growth, record construction activity, and an increase in housing cost, creating an affordability crisis for a large portion of the urban population. The Equity Modeler project is investigating the ongoing gentrification process and inequitable access to opportunities across many of Seattle’s neighborhoods. The project uses publicly available data for GIS-based mapping of equity indicators – related to housing and development, income, mobility, and education – on the city and neighborhood scale. It creates a structural equation model to establish and predict relationships between indicators and analyze policies intended to initiate positive change.

The project creates a tool that brings clarity and direction to an impassioned public discussion and allows stakeholders in the city’s development process to analyze, model, and visualize existing trends and the impact of potential changes in the built environment.
